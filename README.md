# DF(H) bot
A prompt library for Data Fundamentals (H) at UoG, based on Robert Ghrist's Apache Licensed CALCBLUEBOT Template.

## Instructions:
- In the DFHBOT text file (`DFHBOT.txt`), select all.
- Copy and paste into your favorite LLM (large language model), like OpenAI's ChatGPT or whatever other service you prefer.
- Read the list of commands and engage with the tutor.
- Note: reported to work best with GPT-4, but we can't recommend paying for the service just for this bot!

   Using this prompt without Advanced Data Analysis is likely to lead to unstable results (and currently exceeds input length).

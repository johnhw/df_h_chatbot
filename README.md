## Notes from the original repository:
   This prompt template was tuned to OpenAI's GPT-4 with Advanced Data Analysis (formerly Code Interpreter) enabled.
   Using this prompt without Advanced Data Analysis is likely to lead to unstable results (and currently exceeds input length).
   The prompt text file will be updated frequently as test results come in. Please check back and use the latest version.

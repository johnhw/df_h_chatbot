TOPICS:
- representing (edge-weighted) graphs as matrices (e.g. flow)
- simulating flow in a graph using matrix multiplication
- stochastic (and doubly stochastic) matrices
- (integer) matrix powers as repeated linear transformations, i.e. repeated multiplication
- matrix inversion as "undoing" a linear transformation
- conditions for inversion, i.e. non-singularity
- geometric interpretation of singularity: "a collapsed dimension"
- eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Av = \lambda v
- power iteration for leading eigenvalue and eigenvector
- det and trace in terms of eigenvalues
- symmetric square matrices have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors
- complex eigenvalues as indicator of oscillation
- principal component analysis (PCA) as eigenvalue decomposition; eigenspectrums
- use of PCA for dimensionality reduction
- singular value decomposition (SVD) as generalization of PCA to non-square matrices
- singular values and U\Sigma V^T decomposition
- condition number of a matrix as ratio of largest to smallest singular value
- matrix rank (distinguishing clearly from tensor rank in arrays!)
- truncated SVD as low-rank approximation

TOPICS:
- optimisation as a general purpose solution
- the optimisation equation
- approxmation form of optimisation L(\theta) = \sum \| y_i - f(x_i, \theta) \|
- parameters, objective function, constraints and their roles
- equality and inequality constraints
- unconstrained optimisation
- penalisation and penalty functions/soft constraints
- coming up with a good objective function
- discrete and continuous optimisation
- convexity
- continuity
- classes of continuity: none, C^0, C^1, C^2, C^\infty
- differentiability
- local and global optima (maxima, minima)
- combining objective functions using convex sums
- saddle points
- linear regression in an optimisation framework
- parameters of 1D linear regression 
- heuristic optimisation
- convergence graphs and convergence as a function of the number of iterations
- grid search + its issues
- hyperparameters versus parameters
- random search
- stochastic hill climbing
- simulated annealing
- genetic algorithms: mutatation + crossover
- ant colony optimisation
- metaheuristics: population, temperature, memory, stigmergy 
- performance of heuristic optimisation

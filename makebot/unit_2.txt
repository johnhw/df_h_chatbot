TOPICS:
- strides and array layout
- stride vectors 
- dope vectors 
- C and Fortran ordering (row/column major)
- instant transpose etc. with dope vector rewrites
- ellipses and newaxis
- reshape and the "pouring rule" for reshaping
- switching axes to take advantage of broadcasting 
- einsum and its mnemonic indices
- floating point numbers
- IEEE754 standards for float32, float64
- sign, exponent, mantissa (inc. bit lengths and exponent bias, but not subnormal numbers or endianess)
- floats as stretching/squeezing the interval from 1.0 to 2.0 
- machine epsilon
- non-associativity of floating point arithmetic
- round-off error/cancellation error, esp. with addition of big+small or subtraction of two similar numbers 
- IEEE754 special values: NaN, Inf, -Inf and exceptions (overflow, underflow, division by zero, invalid operation) and trapping
- overflow and underflow
- NaN and Inf (including uses of NaNs and how to detect/avoid them)

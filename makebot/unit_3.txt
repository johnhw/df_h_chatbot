TOPICS:
- visualisation and the Wickham's Layered Grammar of Graphics
- facet, layer, geom, mapping, stat, scale, coord, guide 
- origins of visualisation: Playfair, Nightingale
- basics of matplotlib
- examples guides: axes, labels, etc. Importance of labeling axes with units.
- choosing suitable mappings of data to visual attributes
- y versus x mappings (i.e. direction of causality)
- geom properties: shape, colour, size, alpha
- staircase versus line versus scatter plots 
- colour scales, perceptual linearity, colour blindness, perceptually uniform monotonic colour scales, diverging colour scales
- examples coords: polar, loglog, semilog, symlog and when to use them
- coords: aspect, figure size
- details of the Box plot and when to use it 
- example  stats: histogram, Box plot, violin plots, dot plots 
- importance of representing uncertainty in all plots; represent variation when apply a stat that aggregates data
- choosing layers versus faceted plots
- example stats: means, medians, error bars, confidence intervals, standard deviation, standard error, etc.

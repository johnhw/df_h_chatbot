TOPICS:
- representation as vectors (e.g. embeddings)
- notation: R^N for vectors, R^NxM for matrices
- vector spaces and vector operations (add, scalar multiplication)
- topological vector spaces: norms and inner products
- dot product as a way of computing angles between vectors
- operations like means in terms of primitive vector operations
- important norms: L1, L2, Lp, L-infinity, and L_p in general and their properties
- uses of vectors as a versatile lingua franca: images, word embeddings, tabluar data, 3D geometry, etc.
- curse of dimensionality
- non-intuitive properties of high-d space (e.g. density in shells, volume of unit ball, near-orthogonality of all vectors, etc.)
- definition of matrices as linear maps
	- matrices as a way of "encoding" certain classes of functions compactly (i.e. linear functions)
- basic matrix operations: add, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication
- matrix multiply as function composition
- R^(NxM) * R^(MxP) = R^(NxP) rule
- multiplication of multiple matrices as composition of multiple linear maps into one matrix 
- properties of linear maps in geometric terms: linearity, preservation of origin, preservation of lines, preservation of planes, etc.
- definition of linearity  
- all matrix operations as combinations of rotate + scale + rotate 
- transpose of a matrix and (AB)^T = B^T A^T
- important matrix types:
	- square, symmetric, diagonal, triangular, orthogonal, identity, zero, rotation
